To join as one of the network's operators you must register.

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract with your operators display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

After signing up, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and other users can choose you as one of their validators operator.
